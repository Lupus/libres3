LibreS3 - Amazon S3 compatible server
=====================================

LibreS3 is a robust Open Source replacement for the Amazon S3 service,
implementing (a subset of) the S3 REST API.

Standard S3 client libraries and tools (for example s3cmd, python-boto,
ocaml-aws, etc.) can be used to access it. It uses Skylable SX as the
storage backend, which automatically provides data deduplication and
replication.
